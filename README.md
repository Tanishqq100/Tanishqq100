Hey, I’m Tanishq 

I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys building things that actually work.
Most of my work is in Python and JavaScript, and I like backend logic,
automation, and problem-solving more than flashy UI.

What I work with
- Python, JavaScript, Java
- Git & GitHub
- Pandas, NumPy
- Backend logic, automation, APIs

Stuff I’ve built
- House of Holmes  
  Real-world web development work for a fashion/interior design brand.
  Learned how production code actually works.

- Autonomous Workflow Agent
  A Python project where I experimented with automation and task execution.

Right now
I’m focused on improving my backend skills, writing cleaner code,
and turning small ideas into solid projects.
